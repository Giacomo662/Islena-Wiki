# Homepage

This is the homepage of the Official (?) Islena-setting wiki. It is a collection of all the informations us players are given access to as we progress through the story. 
Hopefully, GitHub will be able to handle smoothly the transition to a static webpage, and I won't have to cry in a corner for the rest of my life.
Anyway. Here in the following is an index to navigate through the wiki.

- [Character index](Characterindex.md)
- [Places](Places/Places.md)
- [Loot](Loot/Loot.md)
- [Sessions](Sessioni/Logsession.md)
