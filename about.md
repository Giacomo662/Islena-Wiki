I'm just your average bored physicist and amateur writer that, in his rare free time, had decided to create a public wiki for a friend's D&D 3.5e campaign.
Please, report any issues or inaccuracies you encounter both in the text or in the navigation; I'll do my best trying to fix them!
Hope this can be useful. 
Take care,

Cael
